# motivation about this clone app project
Hello, my name is Jung Hoon Park
This is for development practice.
It is not for production.
I wanted to benchmark famous apps.
Famous apps have a lot of users.
I think that its corporation made an effort to increase UX and process huge traffic.
I want to learn something from this project.
So I started this project.
